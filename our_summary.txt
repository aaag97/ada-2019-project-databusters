- Data cleaning
	-> drop columns: city always chicago, state always IL, location is just repetition of latitude and longitude, three last columns are empty
	-> drop duplicates (The dataset source explicitly says there are)
	-> check for outliers


- Data exploration
	-> most common violations, 
	-> number of violations by establishment type, 
	-> number of violations by period of year, 
	-> number of violations by day of week, 
	-> restaurants on a map, 
	-> concentration index to see where they are mostly located (places to eat out), 
	-> higher risk areas to eat scaled by concentration (heat map), 
	-> introduce new dataset socio-economic, 
	-> show poorer regions, do they correspond to high risk regions ?


- Machine learning part: compute « risk of food-borne illness » index of restaurants, features can be:
        -> region where the restaurant is located (if proven correlated)
        -> past dangerous violations of the restaurant reported by inspectors (for example violation 16. FOOD-CONTACT SURFACES is important with regards to sickness)
        -> proportion of passed inspections by total inspections
        -> Number of complaints

- Introduce Yelp dataset:
        -> Sentiment analysis to extract comments where sickness is mentioned and see most dangerous restaurants according to that metric, do they correspond to high risk restaurants we found in our ML model?
        -> Cluster restaurants by cuisine, do some types of cuisine have more risk than others?
        -> Cluster restaurants by price, do cheaper restaurants have more risk than others?
        -> Can you think of any other metric?
        -> Depending on the new features we found, we can improve our ML model

Proposition: FOOD DESERTS: 
	⁃	Can we see them where there are no supermarkets basically?
	⁃	A lot of researches show that food access inequality is responsible for many community diseases. Are the restaurants present in those neighborhoods also riskier to eat at?
	⁃	Can we see that those same places have higher rates of diseases?


-All told, contaminated food causes 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths each year in the United States.

-Chicago’s segregation is certainly legendary, with the North and South sides divided by class and race. To keep it stereotypically simple: The North Side is white, the South Side is black. The West Side rarely gets acknowledged. There’s less new construction on the South Side, and even when a new restaurant opens, often it won’t receive as much coverage.

-At the start of this project, it did not take long to realize that many Chicago neighborhoods are considered food deserts because of the difficulty residents of these areas have in accessing fresh, nutritious foods, in particular fruits and vegetables. Of note to this Committee is the fact that these food desert neighborhoods are almost exclusively in African American neighborhoods. Therefore, the problem of food deserts in Chicago is not simply a public health issue, but an urgent civil rights issue.
