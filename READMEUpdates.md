# Updates on README from Milestone 1

1. The Yelp Open Dataset was replaed with the Yelp API as the dataset did not contain any information related to Chicago.
2. Milestones were updated to reflect our progress and to mirror the evolution of our ideas for the project.
3. Research questions were also updated such that:
    * They are more specific.
    * They include question from prior README but are more realistic.
    * They reflect recent findings we would like to cover such as Chicago Food Deserts.
4. Datasets were updated such that:
    * Datasets which were not useful were removed.
    * Datasets that were more clean/complete replaced datasets in prior README.
5. A section API's was added and in it we included API's we used to complete our datasets or build secondary datasets (such as the Yelp API).
